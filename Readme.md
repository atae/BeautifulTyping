Beautiful Typing is a series of arcade-style typing challenges that will test the users ability to type in different situations.

##Instructions
  This game requires a keyboard to play. Start the Game or choose a level and type the words as fast and accurately as possible.

##Technologies and Technical Features




### Level Selecting
  The game loop handles one level at a time, but since I needed multiple levels, I created a level selection method that utilizes JSON objects.
